# Auth0 Cordova Sample 01-Login

## Overview
This is a sample that demonstrates how to authenticate with Auth0 via OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect protocols using Universal Links. The sample uses [Cordova Universal Links plugin](https://github.com/nordnet/cordova-universal-links-plugin) to use universal links in cordova. Please refer to the documentation on the plugin in order to setup the universal links. 

The Auth flow will be perfomed in the mobile OS browser using the code grant and PKCE to secure the authorization codes.

### Getting Started

Please clone and configure the `env.example.js` into `env.js`. The attributes domain, clientId and packageIdentifier are mandatory but audience can be omitted.

Then run the following commands to build the cordova 
project, prepare the cordova plugins and finally launch it on ios/android simulator.

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run prepare
npm run ios # or npm run android
```

## Development

Run the watcher to constantly build the application and pipe it to `/www` folder.

```bash
npm run watch
```

The javascript project is built from `src/index.js` to `/www/index.js`.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
